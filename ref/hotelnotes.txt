Guest *
Reservation *
Room * - setprice in constructor?
Bill - invoice_num (a rate number * nights) , room charge, payment_date


Create a Reservation - ask if they've used hotel before, to use existing guest data? if used before, use guest ID, take current date from Calendar object 
if booking is made under booking range of room, do not let them make reservation 
Cancel (Delete) a Reservation -- cascading, useless information

Update Reservation Details -- print the previous old one first when given the id, proceed with update (y/n) (or ask what the user wants to update in the booking)
Display Reservations for Customer
Display Rooms - take in whether they want all, taken, or not taken
Display Room Properties - bed status, smoking or non smoking, 	prints reservation information as well (if any)


Who's currently staying - this is in reference to display room properties
USE CALENDAR OBJECT to CALCULATE THIS!!!!
(like write code to say, oh, the current reservations along with room number are active on this day)


Billing details: display, then prompt if wish to be modified
