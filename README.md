# CA2Softdev3Hotel
A hotel management system built using EclipseLink, JPA and the JDCB. A 2nd year project made with Daria Denisiuk :D
Happy to say this project got an A. Somehow.

		 Note:
		 
		 This project was hilariously out of scope, combined with bad ERD design.
		 
		 However I think we both learned a lot from it, and the reality is not all software is perfect anyway.
		 But I think one thing that's very different to other projects that other people did
		 is a lot of the internal logic behind it. However, this ended up with us being unable to
		 create entries billing table due to time constraints but the rest is pretty solid I feel.
		 
		 If not good, then we tried! I left all our deprecated methods to show that we were working hard at least, haha.
		 
		 If nothing, I think we learned the importance of database design. lol
